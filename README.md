# THIS PROJECT IS PAUSED FOR NOW, WORKING ON AN OSS PROJECT:)
# Qiskit-learning
Howdy. This repo is my intro to Quantum Computing, specifically using Qiskit. Below you will see a list of folders and what they cover. There is no specific order to these, I'm just trying out different ways of learning Qiskit.

## coding-with-qiskit
This folder's purpose is to follow along Dr. Derek Wang's short youtube series in the Qiskit youtube channel. You can find episode 1 of 6 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9LOL9--Y4)

## ideas-for-projects
I decided to take the approach of finding random small projects to start on my own. Ideas come from these websites: 
- [Learn Quantum Computing With These Seven Projects](https://medium.com/qiskit/learn-quantum-computing-with-these-seven-projects-7478d90d125a)

## Websites I have found useful for learning
- [Qiskit Intro](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides)
- [Qiskit SDK](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit)
- [Pauli strings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19287#:~:text=In%20quantum%20computing%2C%20the%20Pauli,operator%20called%20a%20Pauli%20string.)
- [Pauli gates](https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/QC/QuantumComputing_Gate_X.html#:~:text=The%20Pauli%20gates%20are%20a,X%2C%20Y%2C%20and%20Z.)
